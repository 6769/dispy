          dispy Usage
        </h2>
<p>
  There are two ways to create clusters with
  dispy: <tt>JobCluster</tt> and <tt>SharedJobCluster</tt>. If only
  one instance of dispy may be running at anytime,
  <tt>JobCluster</tt> is simple to use; it already contains a
  scheduler that will schedule jobs to nodes running 'dispynode'. If,
  however, multiple programs using dispy may be running at anytime,
  <tt>JobCluster</tt> cannot be used - each of the schedulers in each
  instance of dispy will assume the nodes are controlled exclusively
  by each, causing conflicts. Instead, <tt>SharedJobCluster</tt> must
  be used. In this
  case, <a href="dispyscheduler.html">dispyscheduler</a> must also be
  running on some computer and <tt>SharedJobCluster</tt> must be
  initialized with the node running dispyscheduler (default is the
  host that calls <tt>SharedJobCluster</tt>).
  </p>

<p>Once an instance of JobCluster/SharedJobCluster is created, it can
be used to schedule jobs by specifying arguments to invoke the
computations.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<tt>JobCluster(computation, nodes=['*'], depends=[], callback=None,
           ip_addr=None, port=51347, node_port=51348, fault_recover=False,
           dest_path=None, loglevel=logging.WARNING, cleanup=True,
           pulse_interval=None, ping_interval=None, reentrant=False,
           secret='', keyfile=None, certfile=None)</tt><br/>
where
<ul>
<li>
  <tt>computation</tt> is either name of Python function or a
  string. If it is a string, it must be path to executable program. This
  computation is sent to nodes in the given cluster.
</li>
<li>
  <tt>nodes</tt> is list of nodes, where each node is either IP
  address or host name. This list serves two purposes: dispy initially
  sends a request to all the nodes listed to find out information
  about them (e.g., number of processing units available for dispy),
  then sends given computation to only those nodes that match the
  listed nodes (dispy may know about nodes not listed in this
  computation, as it also broadcasts identification request).
  Wildcard '*' can be used to match (part of) any IP address; e.g.,
  '192.168.3.*' matches any node whose IP address starts with
  '192.168.3'.  If there are any nodes beyond local network, then all
  such nodes should be mentioned in <tt>nodes</tt>. If there are many
  such nodes (on outside local network), it may be cumbersome to list
  them all (it is not possible to send identification request to
  outside networks with wildcard in them); in that
  case, <a href="dispynetrelay.html">dispynetrelay</a> may be started
  on one of the nodes on that network and the node running
  dispynetrelay should be added to nodes list (and a wildcard for that
  network, so that other nodes on that network match that wildcard);
  see below for examples.
</li>
<li>
  <tt>depends</tt> is list of dependencies needed
  for <tt>computation</tt>. Each element of this list can be either
  Python function or Python class or an instance of class (object) or
  a Python module or path to file. Only Python modules that are not
  present on nodes already need be listed; standard modules that are
  present on all nodes do not need to be listed here.
</li>
<li>
  <tt>callback</tt> is a function. When a job's results become
  available, dispy will call provided callback function with that job
  as the argument. If a job sends provisional results with
  'dispy_provisional_result' multiple times, then dispy will call
  provided callback each such time. The (provisional) results of
  computation can be retrieved with 'result' field of job, etc. While
  computations are run on nodes in isolated environments, callbacks
  are run in the context of user programs from which
  (Shared)JobCluster is called - for example, callbacks can access
  global variables in programs that created cluster(s).
</li>
<li>
  <tt>ip_addr</tt> is IP address to use for (client)
  communication. This may be needed in case the client has multiple
  interfaces and default interface is not the right choice.
</li>
<li>
  <tt>port</tt> is port to use for (client) communication. Usually not
  necessary. If not given, dispy will request socket library to choose
  any available port.
</li>
<li>
  <tt>node_port</tt> is port to use for communicating with nodes
  (servers). If this is different from default, 'dispynode' programs
  must be run with the same port.
</li>
<li>
  <tt>dest_path</tt> is directory on the nodes where files are
  transferred to. Default is to create a separate directory for each
  computation. If a computation transfers files (dependencies) and
  same computation is run again with same files, the transfer can be
  avoided by specifying same dest_path, along with the option
  'cleanup=False'.
</li>
<li>
  <tt>fault_recover</tt> must be either True or a string. If it is a
  string, dispy uses it as path to file where it stores information
  about jobs scheduled but not finished yet. In case user program
  terminates unexpectedly (for example, because of network failure,
  uncaught exception), the results of submitted jobs can be later
  retrieved through 'fault_recover_jobs' function (see below). If this
  option is True, dispy will store information about jobs in a file of
  the form '_dispy_fault_recover_YYYYMMDDHHMMSS' in the current
  directory. Note that dispy keeps information about only the jobs
  that have been submitted for execution but not finished yet. Once a
  job is finished (i.e., job result is received by dispy's scheduler),
  its information is lost. If it is necessary to keep the information
  about finished jobs, callbacks can be used to persist job results.
</li>
<li>
  <tt>loglevel</tt> is message priority for logging module.
</li>
<li>
  <tt>cleanup</tt>: Whether any files transferred should be deleted
  after the computation is done. If it is False, the files are left on
  the nodes; this may speedup if same files are needed for another
  cluster later. However, this can be security risk and/or require
  manual cleanup. If same files are used for multiple clusters, then
  cleanup may be set to False and same <tt>dest_path</tt> used.
</li>
<li>
  <tt>pulse_interval</tt> is number of seconds between 'pulse'
  messages that nodes send to indicate they are alive and computing
  submitted jobs. If this value is given as an integer or floating
  number between 1 and 600, then a node is presumed dead if
  5*pulse_interval seconds elapse without a pulse message. See
  'reentrant' below.
</li>
<li>
  <tt>reentrant</tt> must be either True or False. This value is used
  only if 'pulse_interval' is set for any of the clusters. If
  pulse_interval is given and reentrant is False (default), jobs
  scheduled for a dead node are automatically cancelled (for such jobs,
  execution result, output and error fields are set to None, exception
  field is set to 'Cancelled' and status is set to Cancelled); if
  reentrant is True, then jobs scheduled for a dead node are resubmitted
  to other available nodes.
</li>
<li>
  <tt>ping_interval</tt> is number of seconds.  Normally dispy can
  locate nodes running dispynode by broadcasting UDP ping messages on
  local network and point-to-point UDP messages to nodes on remote
  networks. However, UDP messages may get lost.  Ping interval is
  number of seconds between repeated ping messages to find any nodes
  that have missed previous ping messages.
  </li>
<li>
  <tt>secret</tt> is a string that is (hashed and) used for
  handshaking of communication with nodes. This prevents unauthorized
  use of nodes. However, the hashed string (not the secret itself) is
  passed in clear text, so an unauthorized, determined person may be
  able to figure out how to circumvent.
</li>
<li>
  <tt>keyfile</tt> is path to file containing private key for SSL
  communication (see Python 'ssl' module). This key may be stored in
  'certfile' itself, in which case this should be None.
</li>
<li>
  <tt>certfile</tt> is path to file containing SSL certificate (see Python
  'ssl' module).
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
  SharedJobCluster has almost the same syntax, except as noted below:<br />
<tt>SharedJobCluster(computation, nodes=['*'], depends=[], ip_addr=None,
                 scheduler_node=None, port=51347,
                 dest_path=None, loglevel=logging.WARNING, cleanup=True,
                 reentrant=False, secret='', keyfile=None, certfile=None)</tt><br/>
where all arguments common to <tt>JobCluster</tt> are same, and
<ul>
<li>
  <tt>scheduler_node</tt> is either IP address or host name
  where <a href="dispyscheduler.html">dispyscheduler</a> is running; if
  it is not given, the node where SharedJobCluster is invoked is
  used
</li>
<li>
  <tt>pulse_interval</tt> is not used in case of SharedJobCluster;
  instead, 'dispyscheduler' must be called with '--pulse_interval'
  option appropriately.
</li>
<li>
  <tt>secret</tt> is a string that is (hashed and) used for
  handshaking of communication with dispyscheduler.
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
  <tt>cluster.submit</tt> method is available for the cluster returned
  from JobCluster. This method should be called with the arguments
  exactly as expected by the 'computation' given to JobCluster. If
  'computation' is a Python function, the arguments may also contain
  keyword arguments. However, all arguments must be serializable
  (picklable). If an argument is a class object that contains
  non-serializable members, then the classes may
  provide <tt>__getstate__</tt> method for this purpose (see '_Job'
  class in dispy.py for an example). If 'computation' is a program, then
  all arguments must be strings.

  <tt>submit</tt> returns a 'job' object. Results from execution of
  computation with given arguments will be available in the 'job' object
  after execution finishes.
</li>

<li>
  <tt>cluster()</tt> will wait for all submitted jobs to complete.
</li>

<li>
  <tt>cluster.wait()</tt> will wait for all submitted jobs to complete.
</li>

<li>
  <tt>cluster.close()</tt> will wait for all submitted jobs to complete
  and then cleanup (such as removing any transferred files, deleting
  'computation' from the nodes etc.).
</li>

<li>
  <tt>cluster.cancel(job)</tt> will remove the job submitted, by
  terminating it if it already started execution. Note that if the job
  execution has any side effects (such as updating database, files
  etc.), cancelling a job may leave unpredictable side effects,
  depending on at what point job is cancelled.
</li>

<li>
  <tt>cluster.stats()</tt> will print statistics about nodes, time
  each node spent executing jobs etc.
</li>

<li>
As noted above, if 'fault_recover' option is used when creating a
cluster, dispy stores information about scheduled but unfinished jobs
in a file. If user program then terminates unexpectedly, the nodes
that execute those jobs can't send the results back to dispy. In such
cases, the results for the jobs can be retrieved from the nodes with
the function in dispy:<br/>
<tt>fault_recover_jobs(fault_recover_file, ip_addr=None, secret='', node_port=51348,
                       certfile=None, keyfile=None)</tt>
where
<ul>
  <li><tt>fault_recover_file</tt> is path to the file used or created
  when JobCluster is used.</li>
  <li><tt>ip_addr</tt> is IP address to use for (client)
    communication. This may be needed in case the client has multiple
    interfaces and default interface is not the right choice (this
    would be same as the 'ip_addr' option used for JobCluster).</li>
  <li><tt>secret</tt> is a string that is (hashed and) used for
  handshaking of communication with nodes (should same as the one used
  when creating JobCluster).</li>
  <li><tt>node_port</tt> is port to use for communicating with nodes
  (servers). If this should be different from default, 'dispynode'
  programs must be run with the same port. This option should be same
  as the one used when creating JobCluster.</li>
  <li><tt>certfile</tt> is path to file containing SSL certificate (see Python
  'ssl' module) (same as the one used when creating JobCluster).</li>
  <li><tt>keyfile</tt> is path to file containing private key for SSL
  communication (see Python 'ssl' module). This key may be stored in
  'certfile' itself, in which case this should be None. This option
  should be same as the one used when creating JobCluster.</li>
</ul>

This function reads the information about jobs in the
fault_recover_file, retrieves DispyJob instance (that contains
results, stdout, stderr, status etc.) for each job that was scheduled
for execution but unfinished at the time of crash, and returns them as
a list. If a job has finished executing at the time
'fault_recover_jobs' function is called, the information about that is
deleted from both the node and fault_recover_file, so the results for
finished jobs can't be retrieved more than once. However, if a job is
still executing, the status field of DispyJob would be
DispyJob.Running and the results for this job can be retrieved again
(until that job finishes) by calling 'fault_recover_jobs'. Note that
'fault_recover_jobs' is available as separate function - it doesn't
need JobCluster or SharedJobCluster instance. In fact,
'fault_recover_jobs' function must not be used when a cluster that
uses same recover file is currently running.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
Note that dispy sends only the given computation and its dependencies
to the nodes; the program itself is not transferred. So if computation
is a python function, it must import all the modules used by it, even
if the program imported those modules before cluster is created.
</p>

<p>
  'dispy_provisional_result' function can be used in computations
  (python functions) to send provisional results back to the
  client. For example, in optimization computations, there may be many
  (sub) optimal results that the computations can inform the client
  (program) that may cancel computations, or create additional
  computations, etc. 'dispy_provisional_result' can be used to send
  any information, any number of times, back to the client. As an
  illustrative example, consider:
  </p>
<code>#!/usr/bin/env python

import random, dispy

def compute(n, threshold):
    import random, time, socket
    name = socket.gethostname()
    for i in xrange(0, n):
        r = random.uniform(0, 1)
        if r <= threshold:
            # possible result
            dispy_provisional_result((name, r))
        time.sleep(0.1)
    # final result
    return None

def job_callback(job):
    # callback is called for Terminated status, too, in which case
    # job.result would be None
    if job.result is not None:
        if job.result[1] < 0.005:
            print '%s computed: %s' % (job.result[0], job.result[1])
            global jobs, cluster
            for j in jobs:
                if j.status == dispy.DispyJob.ProvisionalResult:
                    cluster.cancel(j)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    cluster = dispy.JobCluster(compute, callback=job_callback)
    jobs = []
    for n in xrange(4):
        job = cluster.submit(random.randint(50,100), 0.2)
        if job is None:
            print 'creating job %s failed!' % n
            continue
        job.id = n
        jobs.append(job)
    cluster.wait()
    cluster.stats()
    cluster.close()
  </code>
<p>
  In the above example, computations send provisional result if
  computed number is <= threshold (0.2). If the number computed is <
  0.005, job_callback deems it acceptable and terminates computations.
  </p>

<p>
  Below are some examples on various use cases of creating clusters:
</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <tt>cluster = dispy.JobCluster(compute, nodes=['node20', '192.168.2.21', 'node24'])</tt>
      sends computation to nodes 'node20', 'node24' and node with IP address '192.168.2.21'; in this case, these nodes could be in different networks, as explicit names / IP addresses are listed.
    </li>
    <li>
      <tt>cluster = dispy.JobCluster(compute, nodes=['192.168.2.*'])</tt>
      sends computation to all nodes whose IP address starts with '192.168.2'.
      In this case, it is assumed that '192.168.2' is local network (since
      dispy can't send identification request to outside networks with wildcard)
    </li>
    <li>
      <tt>cluster = dispy.JobCluster(compute, nodes=['192.168.3.5', '192.168.3.22', '172.16.11.22', 'node39', '192.168.2.*'])</tt>
      sends computation to nodes with IP addresses '192.168.3.5', '192.168.3.22', '172.16.11.22' and node 'node39' (since explicit names / IP addresses are listed, they could be on different networks), all nodes whose IP address starts with '192.168.2' (local network).
    </li>
    <li>
      <tt>cluster = dispy.JobCluster(compute, nodes=['192.168.3.5', '192.168.3.*', '192.168.2.*'])</tt>
      In this case, dispy will send identification request to node with IP address '192.168.3.5'. If this node is running 'dispynetrelay', then all the nodes on that network are eligible for executing this computation, as wildcard '192.168.3.*' matches IP addresses of those nodes. In addition, computation is also sent to all nodes whose IP address starts with '192.168.2' (local network).
    </li>
    <li>
      <tt>cluster = dispy.JobCluster(compute, nodes=['192.168.3.5', '192.168.8.20', '172.16.2.99', '*'])</tt>
      In this case, dispy will send identification request to nodes with IP address '192.168.3.5', '192.168.8.20' and '172.16.2.99'. If these nodes all are running dispynetrelay, then all the nodes on those networks are eligible for executing this computation, as wildcard '*' matches IP addresses of those nodes. In addition, computation is also sent to all nodes on local network (since they also match wildcard '*' and identification request is broadcast on local network).
    </li>
  </ol>
